1. domain appiko.org bought through gandi.net
2. ensure the A record on gandi's settings for this domain point to 192.30.252.153 and 192.30.252.154. Create entries for * and @ names
3. on github's settings for the website dir, ensure the custom domain is specified as appiko.org
4. echo appiko.org > CNAME

If all these steps are in place : it shd work.
